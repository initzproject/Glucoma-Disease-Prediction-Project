# EyeDiseaseClassification

#### 1. For complete explanation about the project can see the Presentation (PPT file) in the repository
#### 2. To see the complete step to make the model can see the ipynb file in the repository


This is my another project with PyTorch to classify Eye Disease to 4 Categories :
1. Cataract
2. Diabetic Retinopathy
3. Glaucoma
4. Normal

Using ResNet-18 Architecture to modelling the dataset.

#### Result Accuracy :

*although the accuracy is already high, it does not rule out the possibility of errors in the classification
